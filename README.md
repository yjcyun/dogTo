  dogTO - <a href="https://blogto.com">blogTO Clone</a>
</h1>

This project was developed with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a> for practice. See below for more detail.


## üßê Frontend Features?

I started this project to practice on some essential frontend functionalities. The goal was not to perfectly clone blogTO but to create responsive and useful features. The project does not contain backend however the site is connected to the Netlify CMS (not all data are coming from the CMS) and the data are queried using GraphQL. 

Features include:

  * Search by select
  * Search by text
  * Mapbox
  * Pagination
  * Load more by button
  * Sorting
  * CSS Grid * Flexbox
  * Dynamic page rendering (Gatsby feature)
